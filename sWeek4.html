	  <h3>Week 4: Race!</h3>
	  <p>
	    The goals for week 4 were to confirm success for our past tasks (visual servoing and exploring
	    space), and to create a system to guide our car through a race course using the skills taught and
	    practiced in past lectures and labs. Because the task was naturally split as it was in week 3, our
	    team split into the same subteams for efficiency. Monday and Tuesday were spent refining and
	    optimizing programs from week 2 and 3 to prepare for the pre-race Tech Challenges. This process
	    included everything from calibrating individual values to reworking entire algorithms.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    A modified potential fields code was implemented that was better suited to navigating through clear
	    paths than obstacle free space. The size of the forwards component was increased to increase speed,
	    and calibrate the variables to make the ACECA follow more towards the middle of the track . A more
	    robust algorithm for blob detection was devised and implemented. The newer program masks the image
	    for all desired colors at the same time, picks the largest identified blob, and finds the color of
	    that area of the image. This algorithm is more reliable than the previous one because it prioritizes
	    size and only size, whereas the former version prioritized color arbitrarily. This was an
	    unintentional side effect of the older program going through one color at a time, making it
	    inefficient for only the biggest one to be taken into account.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Wednesday was spent preparing a system for the final race within Walker Memorial, which would be
	    the real test setting. Because of that, color ranges and values for blob detection were
	    re-calibrated to the new and final setting with success in both detection and a lack of noise. The
	    values within the potential field controller code were re-calibrated for the new and final track. An
	    intermediary node between all the drive controllers was created to decide which node has the most
	    authority based on the conditions at any given time, to avoid conflict between commands or messages
	    inappropriate for the given situation being acted on.
