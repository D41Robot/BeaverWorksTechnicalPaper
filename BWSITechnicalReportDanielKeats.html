(Winter) MIT has designed to courses to teach students about robotic control systems. In total 46 students attended the program, </span><span class="c0">22 students roomed at Boston university and 24 students comminuted from neighboring Boston communities. Together all students students worked together in Building 33 on the MIT campus. The day composed of lab time with the cars and lectures providing knowledge on how to effectively use the car. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c13">Week1 (</span><span class="c0 c13">Chris</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><span class="c0 c13">):</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RACECAR is an acronym that stands for Rapid Autonomous Complex-Environment Competing Ackermann-steering Robot. The onboard computer was a nvidia jetson tx1 embedded systems module GPU, mounted on the nvidia development board. The jetson tx1 has 256 CUDA cores, &nbsp;[1] which provides powerful and quick computing performance. The jetson runs Ubuntu 14.04 natively. The chassis is a Traxxas Rally, with 4 wheel drive and Front wheel steering (hence Ackermann). It interfaces with the jetson through a variable electronic speed control, or VESC. A router is installed on top to provide networking capabilities to the RACECAR.</span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c3 c0">The RACECAR has a robust sensor suite installed. A 2 dimensional 270 degree scanning Lidar is mounted on the front of the RACECAR. Lidar is a technology that uses a laser to detect position in degrees and range of surfaces that it reflects off. This can be used to create a scan of any surfaces within the lidar scan radius . &nbsp;The lidar provides a 40Hz .25 degree resolution, with a range of 0.06 to 10 meters. Also mounted on the car is ZED passive stereo camera. A stereo camera uses two cameras mounted a constant distance from each other that allows the distance of different points in an image to be determined by the parallax of the image. The ZED camera provides full color image and depth perception. For internal telemetry, the RACECAR has an IMU, or an Inertial Measurement Unit. The IMU is capable of measuring linear accelerations along axes, as well as rotational acceleration along 3 axes. An Odometer is also used to give a rough estimate of how far the racecar has gone, although this method is not accurate.</span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c3 c0">The Robotic Operating System, or ROS, is a modular robotic development platform. It uses a series of separate programs called nodes that each accomplish a single goal. These nodes can be programmed independently from each other. Nodes communicate through topics, which allow ROS messages to be sent between nodes. ROS messages can be user defined to transmit any information desired. Through this, a complete series of programs can be launched simultaneously that work together to operate the robot. Due to the modularity of ROS, nodes can be reused in separate projects, greatly reducing development time in some cases.</span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c0">One main goal of this week was to implement a wall following program. In order to accomplish this task, lidar data was used from the side of the desired wall to determine distance from said wall. The car would then use a control system to attempt to maintain a certain distance from the wall. The most basic control system is Bang-Bang. In bang bang, the system outputs two states. If the distance is greater than the desired, the RACECAR will steer inwards at a constant angle. If the distance less than the desired, then it will steer inwards at a constant. A more robust control system is a Proportional integral derivative, or PID, controller. The PID controller uses the sum of three values to determine output. The Proportional value is the deviation from the desired value multiplied by some constant Kp. This allows for the system to respond dynamically to position, with small deviations corresponding to small corrections, and larger errors with larger responses, in this case the steering angle. The Derivative value reduces oscillations in the system b</span><span class="c3 c0">y multiplying the change in error values with a constant Kd. In the RACECAR, this prevents the steering from making constant minute adjustments to the steering angle and keeps a smoother path. The Integral value allows for the correction of an accumulation of smaller errors by taking the integral of the errors over time and multiplying them by a constant Ki. The three values are then summed to give the final desired output. By changing the constants, the system can be tuned to react in the desired manner. In the RACECAR PID controller implementation, the output &nbsp;is the steering angle that is sent to the servo. </span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c3 c0">The final challenge for the week was a drag race style competition. Two different teams placed each car along a different wall. The cars started at the same time, each following a different side. This competition tested the efficiency of each teams code in terms of oscillation reduction and wall following ability. To complete this challenge, a PID controller was implemented, with man teams only using a PD without the Integral component. The Lidar data could be used in several was to find distance from wall, ranging from a single lidar point distance to three point measurements with a known angle between them and distance of each point.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c0">Notes: How the laser works, diagram showing how the car is able to got its distance from wall</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c0">Week2 (Dan):</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c13">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Utilizing the ZED camera the goals for the week was to determine colors, steer based on where the color is and, turn left or right at a distance from the blob based on the color. Monday was spent learning how to use the CV2 functions to determine colors from a picture. To determine a color the image must be turned into a more usable format called HSV. HSV is a different format for writing colors compared to RGB. Typical images are in the RGB format where each pixel has a Red, Green, and Blue value assigned to ranging from 0 to 255. Attempting to work with the RGB color space would require more processing power. The HSV color spaces works on a cylindrical</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c0">format. Once the image is converted into the HSV format processing colors on the image becomes easier. A blob refers to the random shape of a desired color. For the end of week challenge the blob was either a red or green square. Finding the working blob requires creating a mask. The mask filters out all colors except the desired color, example in Figure 2.2. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to mask on single images can easily be transferred to video, video is just pictures right after eachother in a fast motion that the human can not tell the individual images. To process video is real time requires a lot of processing power, thankfully the Jetson has a built in GPU to help with the processing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving towards the technical challenge the tasks was to steer the robot based on where the blob was in the robot&rsquo;s camera. To achieve the steering mechanism once a blob was found the center coordinate of the blob was found. The resolution of the image is 1280 pixels by 720 pixels. Only the X value of the center point was of concern. If the center point at the X value was less than 640 the RACECAR had to turn left. Complementary if the center point at the X value was greater than 640 the RACECAR had to turn right. Along with finding the color of a blob the area of a blob could be determined using the CV2 function called &ldquo;cv2.contourArea(i)&rdquo;. The area composes of all the pixels inside of the mask. For the challenge the area function was used to determine how far away from the blob the RACECAR was. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combining the methods together the code controlled the RACECAR towards the blob until the blob took up most of the camera&rsquo;s vision. Based on the color the code ran another python script that ran a PID controller from week 1 to run the car against the right or left wall. Those goals for the week were achieved, the car steered based on where a colored blob was within its image. Due to hardware issues the motor on the car did not engage properly causing the system to over steer when attempting to follow the wall. With more time the programs would have been able to react to the wall in a more efficient manner. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">. . </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 470.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image02.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 470.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 2.1: </span><span class="c0 c15">Derty, R.

Because this task had two distinct parts, it was approached by splitting into two sub-teams: one handling collision avoidance, the other handling image and blob processing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c0">To implement object avoidance and space exploration, we used a potential fields algorithm. This algorithm is a local route planner that creates a vector field around an objects it detects. In the RACECAR implementation, we used the lidar to get angel and distance of points reflected from objects. These input as vectors, and added together to create a final vector. A large vector is added behind the RACECAR to give it a forwards bias. The summation vector gives the direction in which the racecar should steer to avoid obstacles. This approach works very well as more distant objects have much less effect on the direction than close objects. A properly implemented potential fields controller will even allow the RACECAR to back away from any objects that are too close. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detecting blobs of specified colors and saving images of them is a multistep process. First, an image perceived by the ZED camera is converted into HSV format, before being masked. Then, the image is masked with already specified color ranges. Determining which color ranges to mask to get the appropriate results required logic and sense alongside trial and error. The masks of each color are created one at a time, and this process terminates once a blob of significant size is found. To accomplish the literal detection of color and size, OpenCV contour detection technology is used. Once a blob is identified, it is saved as a .jpg image within a specified directory, with a filename that indicates the color and color-count of that blob.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c0">In order to accomplish the challenge, a launch file was created that launched two other launch files and the two challenge specific nodes. First, the launch file initiated a teleoperation launch file, which allowed for remote control overrides of the vehicle if necessary, as well as beginning the ROS master controller. Next, the Zed Camera launch file was started to give us access to image data. The two nodes that were launched were the potential fields controller that was responsible for the actual driving of the vehicle, and the blob detection node that captured screenshots of identified objects. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the final race, this software caused 17 collisions, but did detect 4 blobs and follow the necessary procedure for each. One of the biggest obstacles for both parts of the task was calibration, and a lack of time to properly test and calibrate values for both of these programs hindered our success. For space exploration, calibration consisted of seeing how the current values within the code caused the car to run, and adjusting those accordingly. For blob detection, calibration consisted of testing our software with provided color swatches on the track, and figuring out the best achievable color ranges (detecting enough of a color to notice it reliably, without catching extraneous traces of it).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Note: insert video of run.

Because the task was naturally split as it was in week 3, our team split into the same subteams for efficiency. Monday and Tuesday were spent refining and optimizing programs from week 2 and 3 to prepare for the pre-race Tech Challenges. This process included everything from calibrating individual values to reworking entire algorit</span><span class="c3 c0">hms. </span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c3 c0">A modified potential fields code was implemented that was better suited to navigating through clear paths than obstacle free space. The size of the forwards component was increased to increase speed, and calibrate the variables to make the ACECA follow more towards the middle of the track . A more robust algorithm for blob detection was devised and implemented. The newer program masks the image for all desired colors at the same time, picks the largest identified blob, and finds the color of that area of the image. This algorithm is more reliable than the previous one because it prioritizes size and only size, whereas the former version prioritized color arbitrarily. This was an unintentional side effect of the older program going through one color at a time, making it inefficient for only the biggest one to be taken into account.</span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c0">Wednesday was spent preparing a system for the final race within Walker Memorial, which would be the real test setting.

Some examples of this are having the car follow the wall at a specified distance based on LIDAR data, determine a left or right turn based on ZED camera data, detect various colors and counts of them with camera data, explore space without collisions, and follow a race course. Overall, this course facilitates greater familiarity with ROS and with the experience of working with software commanding hardware. It teaches what ROS is (an open-source robot operating system), why it is useful (modular in that it allows users to decide amount of reliance on provided framework), and how it works (object nodes publishing and subscribing to one-way topics). It also makes the experience of working with hardware accessible. Having to write, test, and calibrate all these programs exposes both the benefits and limitations of operating on real machines. On one hand, these machines can achieve things that a solely-software program could not, simply due to the fact that they exist in the real world. On the other hand, their existence in the physical world creates issues with limitations such as imperfect sensor readings, a lack of consistency (e.g quicker acceleration with more battery power), and a need to calibrate and test every program physically.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving forward, the RACECAR course could be more explicit about the hardware being used on this platform. While it does discuss the science behind each of the sensors on the vehicle, being able to put the car together or spend time going through each individual component and their connections would have caused a greater appreciation for the hardware being used. More general discussion about the hardware of the RACECAR and how it can react to software commands would have been an enriching experience.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c0">Personal Note (Dan): </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c13">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c0">On behalf of all the students who participated in the BWSI program. A massive thank you goes out to DR. Bob Shinn for putting the program together and allowing the opportunity for everyone to meet. A huge thank you goes out to MIT for allowing the program to use its space. Thank you to all the guest presenters who took the time to give wonderful lectures to the class. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To program brought together students from different backgrounds and cultures to collaborate together. Walking away students have gained to knowledge of lasting friendships and the framework to create robots. As much as the do not want to admit it each and every student has changed so much in the last 4 weeks.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 400.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image01.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 400.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><div class="c5"><p class="c8"><a href="#cmnt_ref1" id="cmnt1">[a]</a><span class="c3 c17">Will put in pics latter</span></p></div><div class="c5"><p class="c8"><a href="#cmnt_ref2" id="cmnt2">[b]</a><span class="c3 c17">This is what, it was mostly calibration, be little innovation</span></p></div></body></html>
