	  <h3>Personal Note</h3>
	  <p>
	    Because of all the team building and cooperation required to succeed, BWSI taught lots of
	    skills to facilitate contributing to group environments. Between communication lectures,
	    disagreements about code, and having to spend 40 hours a week together investing ourselves
	    into the same project, everyone would have to be on the same page for a mission like ours
	    to come to fruition. This forced us to consider each of ourselves merely a part of the
	    bigger picture that is a team; we had to figure out what it is that each of us had to
	    contribute, along with observing what each of our teammates also had to offer. Needing a
	    functional group dynamic to accomplish our goals also made it necessary to constantly
	    evaluate the best way to relate with our teammates: observing their apparent mood or
	    emotions, getting opinions and feedback on proposed idea, and in general establishing a
	    stable line of talking and listening. Overall, we were taught how to work as a team
	    successfully through personal relations and open communications.

	    BWSI brought together students from different backgrounds and cultures in a collaborative
	    and supportive spirit. From this experience we have gained knowledge of many things, from
	    building new friendships to manipulating robots and understanding their underlying
	    structure. As much as the do not want to admit it each and every student has changed so
	    much in the last 4 weeks.

	    On behalf of us, and all the students who participated in the BWSI program, a massive
	    thank you goes out to Dr. Bob Shin for creating this great opportunity that brought all of
	    us together, and to MIT for hosting this program. Thanks go out to all the guest presenters
	    who took the time to give wonderful lectures to the class. Thank you so much to everyone
	    who played any part in making this incredible chance for us.
