	  <p>RACECAR is an acronym that stands for <b>R</b>apid <b>A</b>utonomous
	    <b>C</b>omplex-<b>E</b>nvironment <b>C</b>ompeting <b>A</b>ckermann-steering
	    <b>R</b>obot. The onboard computer was a Nvidia Jetson tx1 embedded systems module
	    GPU, mounted on the nvidia development board. The Jetson tx1 has 256 CUDA cores,
	    [1] which provides powerful and quick computing performance. The jetson runs Ubuntu
	    14.04 natively. The chassis is a Traxxas Rally, with 4 wheel drive and Front wheel
	    steering (hence Ackermann). It interfaces with the jetson through a variable
	    electronic speed control, or VESC. A router is installed on top to provide
	    networking capabilities to the RACECAR.

	    The RACECAR has a robust sensor suite installed. A 2 dimensional 270 degree scanning
	    Lidar is mounted on the front of the RACECAR. Lidar is a technology that uses a laser
	    to detect position in degrees and range of surfaces that it reflects off. This can be
	    used to create a scan of any surfaces within the lidar scan radius .  The lidar provides
	    a 40Hz .25 degree resolution, with a range of 0.06 to 10 meters. Also mounted on the car
	    is ZED passive stereo camera. A stereo camera uses two cameras mounted a constant
	    distance from each other that allows the distance of different points in an image to be
	    determined by the parallax of the image. The ZED camera provides full color image and
	    depth perception. For internal telemetry, the RACECAR has an IMU, or an Inertial
	    Measurement Unit. The IMU is capable of measuring linear accelerations along axes, as
	    well as rotational acceleration along 3 axes. An Odometer is also used to give a rough
	    estimate of how far the racecar has gone, although this method is not accurate.

	    The Robotic Operating System, or ROS, is a modular robotic development platform. It uses
	    a series of separate programs called nodes that each accomplish a single goal. These
	    nodes can be programmed independently from each other. Nodes communicate through topics,
	    which allow ROS messages to be sent between nodes. ROS messages can be user defined to
	    transmit any information desired. Through this, a complete series of programs can be
	    launched simultaneously that work together to operate the robot. Due to the modularity of
	    ROS, nodes can be reused in separate projects, greatly reducing development time in some
	    cases.

	    One main goal of this week was to implement a wall following program. In order to
	    accomplish this task, lidar data was used from the side of the desired wall to determine
	    distance from said wall. The car would then use a control system to attempt to maintain
	    a certain distance from the wall. The most basic control system is Bang-Bang. In bang
	    bang, the system outputs two states. If the distance is greater than the desired, the
	    RACECAR will steer inwards at a constant angle. If the distance less than the desired,
	    then it will steer inwards at a constant. A more robust control system is a Proportional
	    Integral Derivative, or PID, controller. The PID controller uses the sum of three values
	    to determine output. The Proportional value is the deviation from the desired value
	    multiplied by some constant Kp. This allows for the system to respond dynamically to
	    position, with small deviations corresponding to small corrections, and larger errors
	    with larger responses, in this case the steering angle. The Derivative value reduces
	    oscillations in the system by multiplying the change in error values with a constant Kd.
	    In the RACECAR, this prevents the steering from making constant minute adjustments to the
	    steering angle and keeps a smoother path. The Integral value allows for the correction of
	    an accumulation of smaller errors by taking the integral of the errors over time and
	    multiplying them by a constant Ki. The three values are then summed to give the final
	    desired output. By changing the constants, the system can be tuned to react in the
	    desired manner. In the RACECAR PID controller implementation, the output is the steering
	    angle that is sent to the servo.

	    The final challenge for the week was a drag race style competition. Two different teams
	    placed each car along a different wall. The cars started at the same time, each following
	    a different side. This competition tested the efficiency of each teams code in terms of
	    oscillation reduction and wall following ability. To complete this challenge, a PID
	    controller was implemented, with man teams only using a PD without the Integral
	    component. The Lidar data could be used in several was to find distance from wall,
	    ranging from a single lidar point distance to three point measurements with a known angle
	    between them and distance of each point.
