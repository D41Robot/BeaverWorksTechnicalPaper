	  <h3>Technical Conclusions</h3>
	  <p>
	    The lectures and labs of week 1 to week 4 taught and practiced accessing and interpreting
	    of sensor data and making the car react to its environment. Some examples of this are
	    having the car follow the wall at a specified distance based on LIDAR data, determine a
	    left or right turn based on ZED camera data, detect various colors and counts of them
	    with camera data, explore space without collisions, and follow a race course. Overall,
	    this course facilitates greater familiarity with ROS and with the experience of working
	    with software commanding hardware. It teaches what ROS is (an open-source robot operating
	    system), why it is useful (modular in that it allows users to decide amount of reliance
	    on provided framework), and how it works (object nodes publishing and subscribing to
	    one-way topics). It also makes the experience of working with hardware accessible. Having
	    to write, test, and calibrate all these programs exposes both the benefits and limitations
	    of operating on real machines. On one hand, these machines can achieve things that a
	    solely-software program could not, simply due to the fact that they exist in the real
	    world. On the other hand, their existence in the physical world creates issues with
	    limitations such as imperfect sensor readings, a lack of consistency (e.g quicker
	    acceleration with more battery power), and a need to calibrate and test every program
	    physically.
	  </p>

	    Moving forward, the RACECAR course could be more explicit about the hardware being used on
	    this platform. While it does discuss the science behind each of the sensors on the vehicle
	    , being able to put the car together or spend time going through each individual component
	    and their connections would have caused a greater appreciation for the hardware being used
	    . More general discussion about the hardware of the RACECAR and how it can react to
	    software commands would have been an enriching experience.
